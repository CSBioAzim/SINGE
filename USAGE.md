# SINGE usage recommendations
The following guidelines contain best practices for running SINGE on a new dataset.
Please post an [issue](https://github.com/gitter-lab/SINGE/issues) with any questions about how to run SINGE for a particular dataset.

## Importance of ensembling with different hyperparameters
We strongly recommend using the complete SINGE workflow, which includes the SINGE GLG and SINGE Aggregate modes.
We consider each output of the GLG test resulting from a unique hyperparameter combination and subsampled input to be a partial estimate of the true regulatory network.
SINGE's ensembling and modified Borda aggregation is motivated by stability selection from these networks.

## When to change `default_hyperparameters.txt` values
Note that our main intent in choosing the hyperparameter values is to demonstrate SINGE usage, and we do not use different hyperparameter values for different datasets.
However, the choice of hyperparameters can be tuned to prior information regarding the dataset in the form of the type of biological process (time resolution and number of lags), number of genes, number of cells, and sparsity of the dataset (`lambda`, `prob-remove-sample`, and `prob-zero-removal`), quality of pseudotime (`kernel width`), etc.

## Usage with large datasets
### Avoiding glmnet segmentation violation
See [#32](https://github.com/gitter-lab/SINGE/issues/32) and describe workaround

### Choice of `lambda` value
Not meaningful or practical to have complete graph, also causes glmnet errors

## Using a regulator list
SINGE version 0.3.0 introduced functionality where a subset of the gene list is earmarked as candidate regulators.
This is achieved by including a vector `regix` accompanying the expression matrix `X` in the input `.mat` file.
The vector `regix` contains indices corresponding to the rows of `X` which themselves correspond to the genes in the vector `gene_list`.

## How to generate pseudotimes
Given a single-cell dataset, pseudotimes can be generated by inferring a trajectory from the cells.
This process helps to order the cells along the biological process, often also assigning pseudotemporal values to each cell.
We found the `dynverse` (http://dynverse.org/) package to be extremely useful for this purpose.
This package has access to 50+ trajectory inference algorithms, catering to various trajectory types, dataset sizes, etc.
The `dynverse` package provides a streamlined user interface that guides the user through the steps for selecting a trajectory inference method.
If the trajectory inference method itself does not assign pseudotimes, they can be assigned after the fact using the [`add_pseudotime`](https://rdrr.io/github/dynverse/dynwrap/man/add_pseudotime.html) function.
